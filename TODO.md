# GTK2
----------
- Assets need to be organized.
- The dark variant needs to be worked on.

# GTK3
----------
- The slider button for the dark theme is too dark.
- The dialog box buttons have some crazy amount padding that needs to be reduced.
- Decrease the minimum height for headerbar buttons.
- Tab box shadows don't cover all their edges in *some* notebooks.

# Shell
----------
- Remove leftover Minwaita assets and update the assets to match Aduru's.
