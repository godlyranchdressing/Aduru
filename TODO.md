# GTK2
----------
- GTK2 asset sheets might have a couple Adwaita colors floating around in the smaller elements
- Give entries base color as their background
- Slider and scale: the slider has empty space around it while scale highlight looks blurry

# Shell
----------
- Update assets
- Popover menu border color
- Notification banner has some aliasing problems
- See if a hacky solution for suggested and destructive actions can be done
